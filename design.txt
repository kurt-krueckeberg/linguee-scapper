Results are a Top-level associative array with these keys:

- 'query' = The Geramn word for which we request translations and example sentences.

- 'words' = The actual results, a numerically-indexed array of that contains associative subarrays...whose most important key is 

  - 'translations'...which is the key (to single-element numeric array) whose important keys are:
     
    - 'term' which is a single translation

- 'examples' = This doesn't seem to  sentences 

TODO:

The German word has one or translations. Each translation for the German word has one or more German example sentences and their English translations. 
$output['vernachlÃ¤ssigen'] => { {translation1 {Associated Example1, Example2, ...}, {translation2 {Associated Example1, Example2, ...}, ...{translationn {Associated Example1, Example2, ...} };

Idea: 
Use \Ds\Hashtable\ that contains vectors
